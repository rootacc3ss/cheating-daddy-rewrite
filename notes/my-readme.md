# Cheating Daddy Rewrite -- by rootacc3ss
original repo:

https://github.com/sohzm/cheating-daddy

keep your eyes out for *Clue Daddy*, my complete rewrite of Cheating Daddy that aims to fully replicate Cluely's functionality and improve upon Cheating Daddy's already excellent tools.

## what i'm changing

i hope to add the following features (**and maybe even potentially rewrite in to python, to be honest**):
- fix typos

- add a real "homepage" gui that appears upon open to manage settings, knowledgebase, etc; you'll then launch cheating daddy when you're ready

- add support for claude and chatgpt api; gemini remains best for this due to the context window but others may want access to reasoning models for non time sensitive tasks.

- significantly improve the latency on responses for listening

- pick up your responses from your mic to contextualize responses, not just the other party

- beautify the gui a lot, lot more! typing animation for responses, loading screens, overall gui overhaul

- improve the modes; make an auto-solver for things that are on the screen for non-interview or live meetings (at first, this will simply be a hotkey to quickly send in a screenshot with a "solve all problems displayed on the screen)

- create a "custom mode" mode; prompt cheating daddy with what situation you are needing it for if the modes provided don't suffice -- before launching the gui for cheating daddy, you'll simply prompt

- better context engine; create profiles including custom AI instructions, text, pdfs and documents and select said context when opening a new session; failsafe for lost context is a "resend docs" button

- create "custom command" hotkeys -- i.e. if you're taking a subjective personality test for a job, make a hotkey with the prompt "I am taking a test for a job as an office administrator for an insurance company; answer these questions to the best of your ability in context."

- better conversation log; see all inputs, from your mic, screen, what the other party said AND response from

- ask AI about previous meetings using an enhanced database using the new conversation log

- generate follow up emails, summaries, follow up questions and more

- better stealthing features

- deep research function; generate context for the company you're researching (general or specific questions) not only through google search, but before the meeting with a perplexity api key

- and more!
